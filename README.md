# cpp_random_distributions

The idea of this repository is to provide simple and single header-only classes with additional statistical distributions to be used by C++11 random generators.

Most formulas are taken from: "Quickly Generating Billion-Record Synthetic Databases", Jim Gray et al, SIGMOD 1994".
